# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    The team will be meeting Thursdays from 6:30 to 7:30 either over Zoom or ECEb to reconvene on the week's prior goals and go over delivarables 
    before being turned in. This meeting will also serve as a starting point for the upcoming deliverables and work distribution. Each member will 
    take turns being the note taker, meeting lead, and turning in any deliverables outside github. Any needed team work outside the Thursdays meeting 
    can be allocated on a case by case basis. 

2. **Assistance** 
    For any help, questions, or issues that arise communication between members can occur between Discord, Email, and Text Messaging. Expected to 
    respond to these modes of communications withing 36 hours. As weekly meetings look ahead at the upcoming week's work, assitance time may be 
    allocated as well for teamup between members that might need to help each other.  

3. **Respect** 
    Due to the structure of the weekly meetings, each person will be encouraged to express their opinion on each topic discussed and each member 
    will have a vote on each decission made. Each member will have the opportunity to lead the weekly meeting as a different member takes up the 
    role each meeting. In a situation in which disagreements occur, these issues can be discussed throughly and patiently. Each member has full 
    knowledge of what is expected of them and has shared what they expect of their teammates. By signing this contract each member agrees to 
    respect their teammates time, work, and person. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    Each delivarable will be distributed based on group agreement during the weekly meeting and can take volunteers as long as no conflicts arise. 
    In a situation in which more than one member would like to work on the same assignment a discussion about it can arise as a team or both members 
    can contribute to the assignment together. For more extensive assignments, at least two members should be assigned to it and each should discuss 
    how they would like to contribute. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
    All members have prior time commitments with other classes that also include final projects and exams which have been accounted for in our time 
    arrangement for this project. In an occurance of a last minute conflict from a member, they are responcible to communicate it with the rest of 
    the group as soon as they are able to, to give the rest of the members as much time as possible to accomodate the extra work. Each member is 
    expected to work between two to four hours per week depending on our week-to-week goals and deliverables. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
    Any issues and conflicts that arise will be discussed as a group and solved as one. For more serious issues or any issues that could not be 
    resolved as a team, a game of rock, paper, scissors or 'Don't Look Where Im Pointing' should determine the winner and they choose the solution. 
    Any issues relating with a member not contributing as they should will be assessed on a case by case basis and can be excalated to alerting a 
    staff member.
