# Development Log (Date: 10/31/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to look through and decide on the dataset we want to work on and choose what we would want to do with it. Complete data acquisition and familiarize ourselves with data. Complete team contract, porject proposal, and first development log.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Each of us looked through the datasets that were given to us to look through and chose some that we liked. We then came together and discussed our options until we decided on the Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network dataset. All team members worked on the Team Proposal as we discussed what we wanted to abide by before writing it down and what we expected from each other. Carlos and Alex went through the project proposal together with David taking over and aiding in the Data Storage sections. 

## Problems Encountered 
I think this week was heavy for all of us in terms of work, this class also has the MP and Exam due back to back with these assignments and other classes had Labs, Quizzes, and Exams due for us this week as well so I think that time was our biggest issue as we hoped to have moved a bit more ahead and event started on our data storage algorithm by now. 

## Plans for next week
Our goal for next week is to work on creating our data structure for storage and processing our data into our data structure for storage. Complete our data structure storage algorithm along with tests, complete development log, and be halfway done with our traversal algorithm. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
As this project proceeds and maybe suggestions and tweaks arise from what we originally had, would that be viable to have changes or would that cost us points?
